#' tiler: Create map tiles from R
#'
#' The tiler package creates geographic map tiles from geospatial map files or
#' non-geographic map tiles from simple image files.
#'
#' This package provides a tile generator function for creating map tile sets
#' for use with packages such as \code{leaflet}.
#' In addition to generating map tiles based on a common raster layer source,
#' it also handles the non-geographic edge case, producing map tiles from
#' arbitrary images.
#' These map tiles, which have a non-geographic simple coordinate reference
#' system (CRS), can also be used with \code{leaflet} when applying the simple
#' CRS option.
#' \cr\cr
#' Map tiles can be created from an input file with any of the following
#' extensions: tif, grd and nc for spatial maps and png, jpg and bmp for basic
#' images.
#' \cr\cr
#' This package requires Python and the \code{gdal} library for Python.
#' Windows users are recommended to install
#' \code{OSGeo4W}: \code{https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/} as an easy way to
#' obtain the required \code{gdal} support for Python in Windows.
