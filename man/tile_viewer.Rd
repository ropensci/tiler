\usage{
tile_viewer(tiles, zoom, width = NULL, height = NULL, georef = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tiles}{character, directory where tiles are stored.}

\item{zoom}{character, zoom levels full range. Example format: \code{"3-7"}.}

\item{width}{\code{NULL} (default) for geospatial map tiles. The original image
width in pixels for non-geographic, simple CRS tiles.}

\item{height}{\code{NULL} (default) for geospatial map tiles. The original image
height in pixels for non-geographic, simple CRS tiles.}

\item{georef}{logical, for non-geographic tiles only. If \code{viewer = TRUE},
then the Leaflet widget in \code{preview.html} will add map markers with
coordinate labels on mouse click to assist with georeferencing of
non-geographic tiles.}

\item{...}{additional optional arguments include \code{lng} and \code{lat} for setting
the view longitude and latitude. These three arguments only apply to
geographic tiles. Viewer centering is \verb{(0, 0)} by default.}
}
\value{
nothing is returned, but a file is written to disk.
}
\description{
Create an HTML file that displays a tile preview using Leaflet.
}
\details{
This function creates a file \code{preview.html} adjacent to the \code{tiles} base
directory. When loaded in the browser, this file displays map tiles from the
adjacent folder. For example, if tiles are stored in \code{project/tiles}, this
function creates \code{project/preview.html}.

By default, \code{tile()} creates this file. The only reasons to call
\code{tile_viewer()} directly after producing map tiles are: (1) if
\code{viewer = FALSE} was set in the call to \code{tile()}, (2) if \code{tile()} was called
multiple times, e.g., for different batches of zoom levels, and thus the most
recent call did not use the full zoom range, or (3) \code{preview.html} was
deleted for some other reason.

If calling this function directly, ensure that the min and max zoom, and
original image pixel dimensions if applicable, match the generated tiles.
These arguments are passed to \verb{tile_viewer\} automatically when called within }tile()\verb{, based on the source file provided to }tile()`.
