* Bug fix related to system path to `OSGeo4W.bat` being ignored on Windows.

# tiler 0.2.0

* All three `gdal2tiles*` scripts have been updated to accept a command line argument when called by R that provides a path for any temporary files, i.e., `tmp.*.vrt` files created by the `gdal2tiles*` scripts. These were previously accumulating in the system temp folder. The new temporary directory is a sub-directory inside `tempdir()`. Therefore, it is cleaned up when exiting R. Nevertheless, `tile` also force deletes this subdirectory immediately after its internal system call to one of the `gdal2tiles*` scripts returns, so the temporary sub-directory does not even exist for the full duration of the `tile` call.
* Added functions `tile_viewer` and `view_tiles` and other supporting functions for generating HTML Leaflet tile preview web page.
* Added arguments to `tile`. `tile` now generates previewer by default.
* Added unit tests.
* Updated vignette.
